### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. Javasript is used in most all websites. It adds a sense of interactivity to the webpage to give it more than just images and words.
It allows the webpage to react to a user and be more lively.

2. The script element is very important when writing a Javascript. It tells the browser that the scripting engine must interpret the commands it contains.

3. Comments are crucial in javascript coding, because it gives you the opportunity to write out a code and be able to keep it in the file without having it effect the webpage.
   Comments are created with either a '//' or a '/*' if using multiple lines. By taking away those symbols, the code will be added to the webpage and can be tested.
